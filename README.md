# SimpleSite

![Simple Site](img/simple-static-site.png)

  A simple site made using Node, Express, Jade, and Stylus. Based off the tutorial by Ben Gourley that you can read [here](http://www.clock.co.uk/blog/a-simple-website-in-nodejs-with-express-jade-and-stylus).

  To install the dependencies, run on your command line:
  * `npm install`

After the `node_modules` are installed you can begin to edit and build upon it.
